My name is Peiyi Hung (洪培翊). I am an aspiring data scientist finding my first data science job. I strongly believe that we can better understand our world and solve a wide ragne of problems by making good use of data. To effectively utilize data, I am eager to learn all the skills related to data including Statistics, Machine Learning and Programming. 

I earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree both in Econimics from National Chengchi University (Taipei, Taiwan) and National Tsing Hua University (Hsinchu, Taiwan).
