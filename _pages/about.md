My name is Peiyi Hung (洪培翊). I am an aspiring data scientist finding my first data science job. I strongly believe that we can better understand our world and solve a wide ragne of problems by making good use of data. To effectively utilize data, I am eager to learn all the skills related to data science such as Statistics, Machine Learning and Programming.

I earned my bachelor's degree and my master's degree both in Economics from National Chengchi University (Taipei, Taiwan) and National Tsing Hua University (Hsinchu, Taiwan) respectively. During my college year, I developed the ability to make inferences from data and fit mathematical models to data by attending Mathematical Statistics and Econometrics classes. While I was in graduate school, besides taking Machine Learning and advanced Econometrics courses, I completed my graduate thesis on building a LASSO model to predict the waste output of IC industry with the programming lanugage R. The model selected six essential materials from all 126 materials that IC companies use to make products. It yielded a level of mean squared error (MSE) hundreds times lower than a linear regression model without any regularization techniques.

I have never stop learning even after leaving school.
